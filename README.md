# Animated Splash Screen Example

Based on [this example](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-splash-screen) from Expo.

The main difference from the original demo is that here we load the splash screen asset from the local file system, instead of from a remote URL (adding a local URL broke the original example, and wasn't realistic to begin with).

## ðŸš€ How to use

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to try it out.
- Wait until the app is built and downloaded. Press "run again" to reload the app and splash screen.
